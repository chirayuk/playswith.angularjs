          Karma runs your unit tests faster than any other
          tool we know.  The 1K+ AngularJS tests run in ~3
          seconds. It runs tests every time you save. It
          runs tests on real browsers including Android
          and iOS.  It integrates with WebStorm's
          debugger. It works with any test framework, but
          comes with specific support for Jasmine and
          Mocha, and AngularJS' scenario runner. It will
          change your life. No, we can't believe the name
          either.

          Want to see which elements have data bindings, the inheritance tree

          pane? Well then, the AngularJS debugger extension could be for you.

          Yeoman is the swiss-army knife of command-line tools you'll need to
          build a production-ready web application. The list of features is
          extensive and includes scaffolding, compiling (CoffeeScript,
          Compass), linting, package management, and the list goes on. We've
          worked with the Yeoman team to create Angular-specific support. Check

          Packaged apps in Chrome let you create desktop-like applications that
          get delivered like web pages. They can have native-like features like
          accessing the file system, hardware devices, etc. In short, the sky's
          the limit in what they can do. There's a <a
