title: Complimentary Libraries, Tools, and Techniques
description: |
    Below are several tools, libraries, tutorials, guides, etc. that we've
    found useful in developing AngularJS applications. We can't guarantee the
    usefulness of any of these for your particular project, but we've worked
    with each of them to varying degrees and they all look worth investigating.
    Do you have something we've missed and should list here? Please tell us via
    Google+ or Twitter (+angularjs and @angularjs, respectively).
